% Load and plot attenuation and dispersion from csv-files. 
%
% The data is organized into three folder, which are:
% 1.) data_comp:    Contains the csv-files from the compression tests.
% 2.) data_shear:   Contains the csv-files from the shear tests.
% 3.) data_network: Contains the m-files with the geometry of the fractures
%
% The csv-files consists of 8 columns which are the following:
% 1.) time:               The logarithm with base 10 of the frequency
% 2.) MMP_eps_imag:       The imaginary part of the integrated strain
% 3.) MMP_eps_real:       The real part of the integrated strain
% 4.) MMP_sigma_imag:     The imaginary part of the integrated stress
% 5.) MMP_sigma_real:     The real part of the integrated stress
% 6.) attenuation:        Attenuation
% 7.) dispersion:         Modulus dispersion
% 8.) omega_times_volume: A control quantity depending on frequency
% Note: 
% - Integrated strain and stress are not normalized by the sample volume. 
% - Dispersion is in N/(mm^2) and needs to be multiplied by 10^6 to obtain 
%   SI units. 
% - The components of the integrated strain and stress depend on the test. 
%
% The m-files in data_network contain for each fracture network: 
% - the x-coordinate of the center point of each fracture (frac_fx_*)
% - the y-coordinate of the center point of each fracture (frac_fy_*)
% - the length of each fracture (frac_len_*)
% - the thickness (aperture) of each fracture (frac_thick_*)
% - the orientation of each fracture (frac_angle_*)
%
% Note:
% - All files need to be computed for the same amount of frequencies. 
% - Paths to directories are for linux systems. Change the orientation of
%   the slash for Windows systems.
